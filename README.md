What does this button do?
Round 2!

So I finally got some kind of model to display. But apparently it doesn't have a proper material format, so it's always displayed in red. There's no documentation on specifically what's an acceptable .dae or .obj file. Based on the warning messages, I have to do some research on what makes a proper 3d model, and how three.js displays it, and how aframe simplifies the process, in order to determine where I went wrong, and THEN figure out what options are available in aframe, what options are available in three.js, and what path of many possible paths to take to resolve this issue in a timely matter, if determined at all possible.
